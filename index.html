    <h1>Jack Linton's Dev Portfolio</h1>
      <p>I am a former horticulturist and farmer who has grown high quality food using modern, large-scale hydroponic greenhouse systems, smaller organic field growing operations, and I was even the CEO and founder of my own indoor urban mushroom farm in an old warehouse facility in Philadelphia. I am a graduate of the New York Code and Design Academy and I am starting a new career as a full stack app developer. One day I would like to combine my love of growing high quality food with my love of making reliable and enjoyable technological applications to enhance people's personal, career, and educational lives.
