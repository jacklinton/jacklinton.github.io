## Jack Linton's Dev Portfolio

I am a former horticulturist and farmer who has grown high quality food using modern, large-scale hydroponic greenhouse systems, smaller organic field growing operations, and I was even the CEO and founder of my own indoor urban mushroom farm in an old warehouse facility in Philadelphia. I am a graduate of the New York Code and Design Academy and I am starting a new career as a full stack app developer. One day I would like to combine my love of growing high quality food with my love of making reliable and enjoyable technological applications to enhance people's personal, career, and educational lives.

Below you will find short descriptions and links to some of the projects I am working on. Thankyou for visiting my site and I hope that you will take some time to test and enjoy my work. I would love to hear from you about what you think, and you can find my contact information at the bottom of the page.
